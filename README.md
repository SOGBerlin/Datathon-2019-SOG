# Datathon-2019-SOG

## Intro

[Studieren Ohne Grenzen](https://www.studieren-ohne-grenzen.org/) (SOG) awards scholarships to students in need from the world’s conflict zones and aims to improve local education infrastructure.
Studieren Ohne Grenzen collects surveys from their scholarship participants every year to assess the impact of their program and collect feedback on how well it meets the participant’s needs. Now the local Berlin group want to explore these 50+ survey responses for common topics and correlations between answers.
