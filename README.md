# Data Science For Social Good Berlin Datathon 2019 - *Studieren ohne Grenzen* Project

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Intro

[Studieren Ohne Grenzen](https://www.studieren-ohne-grenzen.org/) (SOG) awards scholarships to students in need from the world’s conflict zones and aims to improve local education infrastructure.
Studieren Ohne Grenzen collects surveys from their scholarship participants every year to assess the impact of their program and collect feedback on how well it meets the participant’s needs.
Now the local Berlin group want to explore these 50+ survey responses for common topics and correlations between answers.

## What is in the data

The Spreadsheet contains several sheets providing survey data from three different years: 2017, 2015, 2014

For every survey data set there is a data dictionary, giving details about the questions and answering options (e.g. binary, ordinal scale, free text).

Over the years the surveys changed, some questions were added, some removed and others were changed. There are also similar, corresponding questions from different years, which are highlighted in the data dictionaries.

## Data pipeline

### Step 1 - Preprocessing
* [Cleansing of data sets](tbd)
* [Consolidation into one data set](tbd)

### Step 2 - Transformation and EDA
* [NLP: Preprocessing of free text inputs](tbd)
* [EDA: Insights and visualization from non text answers](tbd)

### Step 3 - Insight generation
* [Identification of success factors](tbd)
* [Identification of strengths and weaknesses in the program and surveys](tbd)
* [NLP: Topic extraction and sentiment analysis](tbd)

### Step 4 - Deployment
* [Shiny application](tbd)
* [Report (Markdown document)](tbd)

We would like to use this repo as a container for any scripts / Jupyter Notebooks that were developed during the DSSG Berlin Datathon 2019.
